		<h2>HTML is all about organizing information.</h2>
		<p>Different heading tags let you specify a hierarchy of headings, subheadings, and sections. You can also organize all of this information into Divs, Sections, or other organizing element tags.
		<div>
			<h3>There is no singular right way to use all of these tags</h3>
			<p>You should generally not skip heading levels (H1, H2, H3, etc.). The different levels are not about sizing, but about <em>hierarchy</em>.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>HTML cannot do much on its own</h3>
			<p>If you’re getting frustrated with the limitations of HTML, good! It’s pretty useless without some CSS, which we’ll get into with the next demo.</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>This is a second section</h2>
		<p>This section only exists to demonstrate that you can have multiple "section" tags in an HTML file.</p>
