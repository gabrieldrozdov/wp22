	<p>So far, everything you’ve seen has been attached to the top-left corner of the browser window. How do we change that?</p>
	<p>Answer: the <strong>position</strong> and <strong>display</strong> attributes!</p>

	<div class="div1">
		So this is one of those Div things we’ve been playing with. Notice how it stretches across the whole browser window. This is because it’s "display" parameter is set to "block".
	</div>
	<div class="div2">
		If we instead set it to "inline", we only get this rectangle. 
	</div>

	<br><br><br>

	<div class="div2">
		And if we have multiple Divs side-by-side, they end up on the same line now. 
	</div>

	</div>

	<p>What if we wanted one box that *wasn’t* full width, but was centered?</p>

	<div class="div3">
		<div class="div3-child">We could have a Div <em>inside</em> another Div! The "text-align" property then lets us center things.</div>
	</div>

	<p>There are even better and easier ways to do this, but we’ll keep it simple for now.</p>

	<div class="border"></div>

	<p>What about the "position" property in CSS? By default, everything is pretty much set to "static" positioning. You’ve already gotten a sense about how that works.</p>

	<p>Look at the bottom of the browser window to see "absolute" positioning.</p>

	<div class="div4">
		Absolute positioning sets the position relative to some parent. In this case, the parent is the "body" tag.
	</div>

	<div class="div5-parent">
		<div class="div4">
			This is a Div in a Div. The parent Div has position set to "relative", and the child has position set to "absolute". The child’s position will now be set <em>relatively</em> to the parent element.
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>What if you want something to stay still no matter what (including if the screen is scrolled)? That’s called "fixed" positioning! This page would look like a disaster with a fixed element on the screen, so you can test that on your own.</p>


	<p>There’s one more position value worth looking at called "sticky". We’ll take a look in the next demo.</p>
