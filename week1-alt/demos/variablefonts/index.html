	<p>One exciting and new(ish) way to animate text is through <strong>variable fonts</strong>. Variable fonts are like the keyframed animations from the last demo, except that the keyframes are integrated into the font files themselves. For instance, this could mean that you can smoothly transition a font from a light weight to a heavy weight.</p>

	<p>Where can you find variable fonts? The easiest place is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?vfonly=true" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>!</p>

	<p class="variable1">Look at how cool this is!</p>

	<p class="variable2">(Hover over me!) You can also use hover selectors to affect variable fonts!</p>

	<p>Different variable fonts have different variable sliders, so make sure your CSS code is appropriately targeting the right variable paramaters. For the font here (Raleway), there is only a "wght" parameter affecting font weight. You can see a whole range of other options <a href="https://v-fonts.com/" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>
