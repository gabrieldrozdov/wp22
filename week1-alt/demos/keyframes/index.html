	<p>With hover states, an element transitions from one set of CSS properties to another. What if we could do this automatically? We can!</p>

	<p class="animation1">Look at me go!</p>

	<p>How did we do that? By using something called @keyframes! This lets us specify the CSS properties to interpolate between, so that an element can go from one set of properties to another automatically.</p>

	<p class="animation2">It works for any CSS properties!</p>

	<p class="animation3">Your animation can have multiple keyframes!</p>

	<p>There are multiple CSS properties relating to keyframed animations, including ones that let you change the smoothing, the animation direction, the animation duration, and how many times the animations loops (if at all). Check them all out <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp" target="_blank">here!</a></p>
