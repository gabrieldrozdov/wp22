	<p>Hover states can look janky without some smoothing. We can do that through the "transition" property by specifying the number of seconds we want the transition to take.</p>

	<p class="hover1">Hovering over this paragraph shows how you can smooth all properties at once.</p>

	<p>What if we want to target only a couple of specific properties? Thatâ€™s easy!</p>

	<p class="hover2">Hovering over this paragraph only smooths the change in border radius and font color.</p>

	<p>I pretty much always go for .2s transitions and keep the default transition properties, but you can go wild if you want with the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp" target="_blank">info here</a>.
