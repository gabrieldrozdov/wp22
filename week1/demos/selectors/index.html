	<p>Now you’ve gotten a whole bunch of overwhelming tools to make use of. As you experiment, they’ll start to get pretty messy pretty fast. But luckily, there are ways to keep things organized! One of those ways is called <em>selectors</em>.</p>

	<p>Let’s say you have a Div. Inside your Div, you have more Divs, and you want every <em>child</em> of the <em>parent</em> Div to have the same styles. You can do that! Just give the parent Div a class, and then set up CSS styles to apply to every child Div of that parent.</p>

	<div class="parent">
		<div></div>
		<div></div>
		<div></div>
		<div></div>
		<div></div>
	</div>

	<p>This is the absolute most basic kind of selector combination. You have a whole wealth of options: just check out <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp" target="_blank">this page</a> to see what kinds of elements you can target!</p>

	<p>One handy selector is the * selector. By itself, the * targets everything on a page. So, if you’re looking to make everything into one font family, you can use the * for simplicity’s sake!</p>
