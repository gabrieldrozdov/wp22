	<h1>Websites are like boxes within boxes within boxes of information. What do those boxes look like?</h1>
	<div class="div1">
		<h2>Let’s look at a Div</h2>
		<p>Divs have <em>margins</em>, <em>padding</em>, and <em>borders</em>.</p>
		<p>This Div has:
			<ul>
				<li>100px of margins on all sides (outside of the border)</li>
				<li>100px of padding on all sides (inside of the border)</li>
				<li>100px border on all sides (between the padding and margin)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="div2">
		<h2>Here's another Div</h2>
		<p>You can also set each side individually for margins, padding, and border. This leads to *funky business*.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="div3">
		<h2>Here's a third Div</h2>
		<p>Additionally, you can set a Div’s width and height. You can also give it a background color!</p>
	</div>
	<div class="div3 div4">
		<h2>Here's a fourth Div</h2>
		<p>Normally, the padding and border are added onto the element’s width and height. If you change the "box-sizing" property to "border-box", padding and border are included in the width and height.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="div5">
		<p>Margin defines the area around an element. Two elements can share the same margin space. This means that if two elements have a margin of 100px, the space between them will be 100px, not 200px.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="div5">
		<p>This means that this element is only 100px away from the previous one.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="div6">
		<p>Two elements can’t share the same padding space. This means that if two elements have padding of 100px, the space between them will be 200px.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="div6">
		<p>This means that this element is 200px away from the previous one.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="div7">
		<p>One more way to stylize this so-called box is to give it a border radius!</p>
	</div>
	<div class="div8">
		<p>Border radius affects the background color of an element, too.</p>
	</div>
