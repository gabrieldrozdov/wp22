	<!-- This is a comment! -->

	<p>This page is an overview of the most important HTML tags.</p>
	<p>Look at the source code, and keep an eye on the notation for different elements/tags. Most elements need a start AND end tag to be properly recognized by a web browser.</p>
	<p>Remember — you don’t have to actually remember anything! Everything you can possibly need to know is already online. Time to get good at searching for information!</p>
	<p>There are many more tags, but these are the most essential for building a vast majority of webpages. If you want to see a full list, check out <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/" target="_blank">this page</a> from W3Schools.</p>

	<br><br><br> <!-- just a few line breaks to make the page easier to read -->

	<!-- Headings -->
	<h1>This is a Heading 1 element.</h1>
	<h2>This is a Heading 2 element.</h2>
	<h3>This is a Heading 3 element.</h3>
	<h4>This is a Heading 4 element.</h4>
	<h5>This is a Heading 5 element.</h5>
	<h6>This is a Heading 6 element.</h6>

	<br><br><br> <!-- just a few line breaks to make the page easier to read -->

	<!-- Paragraphs -->
	<p>
		This is a Paragraph element.
		<br>This text is preceded by a forced line break.
		<br><strong>This is an inline Strong (bold) element.</strong>
		<br><em>This is an inline Emphasis (italic) element.</em>
		<br><span>This is an inline Span element, which lets you add custom CSS styles to text inside of another element.</span>
		<br><a href="#">This is a Link inside of a paragraph.</a>
	</p>

	<br><br><br> <!-- just a few line breaks to make the page easier to read -->

	<!-- Lists -->
	<ul>
		<li>This is an Unordered List.</li>
		<li>You can have as many elements as you want.</li>
	</ul>
	<ol>
		<li>Ordered Lists are very similar.</li>
		<li>Again, you can have as many elements as you want.</li>
	</ol>

	<br><br><br> <!-- just a few line breaks to make the page easier to read -->

	<!-- Divs -->
	<div>
		<h2>Div containers</h2>
		<p>Divs are containers that can hold other elements, including other Divs.</p>
	</div>

	<br><br><br> <!-- just a few line breaks to make the page easier to read -->

	<h2>Links</h2>
	<a href="">
		<div>
			This is a Div inside of a Link. Notice how the area you can click on extends to the right, beyond the text.
		</div>
	</a>
	<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Links can send you to other websites.</a>
	<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Links can even force you to open a new tab when you click them.</a>
	<br><a href="CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.png" target="_blank">Links can open local files. These can be anything, like images, documents (such as PDFs), or even other HTML files.</a>
	<br><a href="subfolder" target="_blank">If a link sends you to local folder without specifying a specific file in that folder, it will default to opening the “index.html” files within that folder.</a>
	<p>Links send you to other elements on the same page too. These are called anchor links, but we’ll go over them in another demo.</p>

	<br><br><br> <!-- just a few line breaks to make the page easier to read -->

	<!-- Images -->
