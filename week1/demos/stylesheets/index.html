	<p>Your index.html document is looking a bit busy. Are you having trouble telling the HTML and CSS apart? No worries, we can put all the CSS into a separate document!</p>
	<p>In your pageâ€™s "head" tag, you can add a link to a stylesheet.</p>
	<p>The notation for ".css" files is almost identical to how we were writing it in previous demos. The main difference is commenting a CSS file uses a different notation.</p>
