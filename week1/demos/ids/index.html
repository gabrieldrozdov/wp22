	<p>Let’s say your page is getting complicated. We want a way to link to content <em>on the same page</em>. The solution: IDs and anchor links!</p>
	<p>Any element can have an ID. You can even target an ID in your CSS to give it custom styles.</p>
	<p>There are a couple of CSS styles that make sections work better:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>"scroll-margin-top" offsets the top of the section. This is useful when you don’t want the top of the section to be at the *exact* top of the screen when you link to it.</li>
		<li>"scroll-behavior" lets you make the scroll to a section animated instead of just a jump.</li>
	</ul>

	<a >By starting the "href" field with a hashtag, we can link to a section on the same page. Try it!</a>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#coolsection">Link to the cool section</a></li>
		<li><a href="#boringsection">Link to the boring section</a></li>
	</ul>
