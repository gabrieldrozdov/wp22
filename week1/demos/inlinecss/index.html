	<p>CSS is how you get things from looking *default* to looking <span style="font-size:64px">*snazzy*</span>.</p>

	<div style="border:1px solid black;">
		<ul>
			<li>You can add inline CSS to any element.</li>
			<li>Look at the source code to see the notation needed. This notation is always in the starting tag for an element.</li>
			<li style="color:red; font-size:24px;">There is no limit to how many styles you apply to an element. If you want multiple styles, make sure to separate them by a semicolon.</li>
			<li style="text-decoration: underline;">The downsides of inline CSS are that you can’t reuse styles, and that things get very unorganized.</li>
			<li style="opacity:.5">What if you want every list item to look exactly the same? That’s what we’ll cover in the next demo.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
